Good Will Hunting
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
I would go to the Amalfi Coast, Italy.
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
I would want to have the power of time travel because I could live in any time period and experience the cultures of different places at different times.
