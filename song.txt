Y.D.L.R. by Tory Lanez

Come in
I know you went and found somebody new (ooh, whoa, whoa)
When all my friends are showing me new pics of you (oh, oh)
All on the 'Gram with your man
Smilin', holdin' hands like
He just do you so much better than I do (ooh, whoa, whoa)
Knew this day would soon be comin'
Guess I didn't expect that it'd be this soon
I guess what I'm tryna to say is (say, say, say, say, yeah)
I know this ain't right for the time, but
Y'all don't look right together (look right)
Y'all don't look right together (look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever
Y'all don't look right together (look right)
Y'all don't look right together (look right)
Y'all don't look right togethеr
You look like mine forevеr, mine forever
Know I sound like I'm hating when I'm being honest (ooh, whoa, whoa)
Just tryna put my feelings somewhere I can't find them (oh, oh)
'Cause them shits have me actin' scary
Feel like a knife is goin' through my chest and I can't seem to get it out
Look, when we argued, it was nothin' this bad
Everything you do, it seem to make me so sad
But it don't mean that we should not get time to reconvene
'Cause who you need is me and, plus y'all don't look right
Y'all don't look right together (y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together (y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever
Y'all don't look right together (y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together (y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever
Y'all don't look right together (y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together (y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever
Y'all don't look right together (y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together (y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever
Show, ooh whoa, whoa
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
